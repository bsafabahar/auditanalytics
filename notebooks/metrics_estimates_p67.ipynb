    "Statisticians estimate; business analysts measure. Statisticians often use the terms *statistic* and *estimate* for values calculated from the data, to draw a distinction between interpretations of the data, and the 'true' state of affairs. Data scientists and business analysts are more likely to refer to such values as a *metric*. The difference reflects the approach of statistics versus data science: accounting for uncertainty lies at the heart of the discipline of statistics. Business or organizational objectives are the focus of data science.\n",
